    Welcome to my website!
    <br>
    <br>
    This website was created on the 10th of January 2018 as an attempt to diversify my skill set, maybe it will work, maybe it won't, only time will tell!
    <br>
    <br>
    Finally brought to the internet for real on the 9th on September 2018, no pressure and all that.
    <br>
    <br>
    Can you tell I'm not a web developer?

<section id="about">

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    I'm a bit of technophile, bit of a retro lover, a bit afraid of over-development, and a whole lot of "quirky"

</section>

<section id="education">

    <h2>Education</h2>

   All the stuff I've 'officially' been 'taught'

</section>

<section id="skills">

    <h2>Skills</h2>

    This section is for my skills... I swear it's not always this empty here.

</section>

<section id="experience">

    <h2>Experience</h2>

    All the places I've done business things at, whether or not they wanted me to or paid me for them.

</section>

<section id="projects">

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    Space for any projects I feel are noteworthy, even if they're completely out of my current skill-set and ability to complete.
    <br>
    <br>
    Currently I'm designing this website (obviously), working on a Java application that does stuff, and continuing development on a discord bot in python.
