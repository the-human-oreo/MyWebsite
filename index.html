            Welcome to my website!
        <br>
        <br>
            This website was created on the 10th of January 2018 as an attempt to diversify my skill set, maybe it will work, maybe it won't, only time will tell!
        <br>
        <br>
            Finally brought to the internet for real on the 9th on September 2018, no pressure and all that.
        <br>
        <br>
            Can you tell I'm not a web developer?
